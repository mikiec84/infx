Description: Access to image-based high throughput screening data collected by
    the InfectX/TargetInfectX experiments is provided from R. Several
    kinome-wide RNA interference screens performed on HeLa cells in presence
    of a selection of bacterial and viral pathogens, using oligo libraries
    form Ambion, Dharmacon and Qiagen are available and further genome-wide
    screens are forthcoming. The full data obtained from these experiments is
    accessible, including raw microscopy images, object segmentation masks,
    feature data calculated using CellProfiler and infection scoring data,
    alongside rich meta data and quality control data.
